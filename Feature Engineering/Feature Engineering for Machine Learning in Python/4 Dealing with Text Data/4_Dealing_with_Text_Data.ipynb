        "# 1. Introduction to Text Encoding\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "So far in this course you have dealt with data that, while sometimes messy, has been generally columnar in nature. When you are faced with text data this is often not going to be the case.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "2. Standardizing your text\r\n",
        "Data that is not in a predefined form is called unstructured data, and free text data is a good example of this. Before you can leverage text data in a machine learning model you must first transform it into a series of columns of numbers or vectors. There are many different approaches to doing this and in this chapter we will go through the most common approaches. In this chapter, you will be working with the United States inaugural address dataset, which contains the text for each President's inaugural speech. With George Washington's shown here. It is clear that free text like this is not in tabular form.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "3. Dataset\r\n",
        "Before any text analytics can be performed, you must ensure that the text data is in a format that can be used. The speeches have been loaded as a pandas DataFrame called speech_df, with the body of the text in the 'text' column as can be seen by looking at the top five rows using the head() method as shown.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "4. Removing unwanted characters\r\n",
        "Most bodies of text will have non letter characters such as punctuation, that will need to be removed before analysis. This can be achieved by using the replace() method along with the str accessor. We have used this in an earlier chapter, but instead of specifying the exact characters you wish to replace, this time you will use patterns called regular expressions. Now unless you go through the text of all speeches, it is difficult to determine which non-letter characters are present in the data. So the easiest way to deal with this to specify a pattern which replaces all non letter characters as shown here. The pattern lowercase a to lowercase z followed by uppercase A to uppercase Z inside square brackets basically indicates include all letter characters. Placing a caret before this pattern inside square brackets negates this, that is, says all non letter characters. So we use the replace() method with this pattern to replace all non letter characters with a white-space as shown here.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "5. Removing unwanted characters\r\n",
        "Here you can see the text of the first speech before and after processing. Notice that the hyphen and the colon are missing.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "6. Standardize the case\r\n",
        "Once all unwanted characters have been removed you will want to standardize the remaining characters in your text so that they are all lower case. This will ensure that the same word with and without capitalization will not be counted as separate words. You can use the lower() method to achieve this as shown here.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "7. Length of text\r\n",
        "Later in this chapter you will work through the creation of features based on the content of different texts, but often there is value in the fundamental characteristics of a passage, such as its length. Using the len() method, you can calculate the number of characters in each speech.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "8. Word counts\r\n",
        "Along with the pure character length of the speech, you may want to know how many words are contained in it. The most straight forward way to do this is to split the speech based an any white-spaces, and then count how many words there are after the split. First, you will need to split the text with with the split() method as shown here and\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "9. Word counts\r\n",
        "then chain the len() method to count the total number of words in each speech.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "10. Average length of word\r\n",
        "Finally, one other stat you can calculate is the average word length. Since you already have the total number of characters and the word count, you can simply divide them to obtain the average word length.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "11. Let's practice!\r\n",
        "Now it's time for you to practice what you have learned about how to manipulate text."

        "# 1. Word Count Representation\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Once high level information has been recorded you can begin creating features based on the actual content of each text.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "2. Text to columns\r\n",
        "The most common approach to this is to create a column for each word and record the number of times each particular word appears in each text. This results in a set of columns equal in width to the number of unique words in the dataset, with counts filling each entry. Taking just one sentence we can see that \"of\" occurs 3 tines, \"the\" 2 times and the other words once.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "3. Initializing the vectorizer\r\n",
        "While you could of course write a script to do this counting yourself, scikit-learn already has this functionality built in with its CountVectorizer class. As usual, first import CountVectorizer from sklearn dot feature_extraction dot text, then instantiate it by assigning it to a variable name, cv in this case.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "4. Specifying the vectorizer\r\n",
        "It may have become apparent that creating a column for every word will result in far too many values for analyses. Thankfully, you can specify arguments when initializing your CountVectorizer to limit this. For example, you can specify the minimum number of texts that a word must be contained in using the argument min_df. If a float is given, the word must appear in at least this percent of documents. This threshold eliminates words that occur so rarely that they would not be useful when generalizing to new texts. Conversely, max_df limits words to only ones that occur below a certain percentage of the data. This can be useful to remove words that occur too frequently to be of any value.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "5. Fit the vectorizer\r\n",
        "Once the vectorizer has been instantiated you can then fit it on the data you want to create your features around. This is done by calling the fit() method on relevant column.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "6. Transforming your text\r\n",
        "Once the vectorizer has been fit you can call the transform() method on the column you want to transform. This outputs a sparse array, with a row for every text and a column for every word that has been counted.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "7. Transforming your text\r\n",
        "To transform this to a non sparse array you can use the toarray() method.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "8. Getting the features\r\n",
        "You may notice that the output is an array, with no concept of column names. To get the names of the features that have been generated you can call the get_feature_names() method on the vectorizer which returns a list of the features generated, in the same order that the columns of the converted array are in.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "9. Fitting and transforming\r\n",
        "As an aside, while fitting and transforming separately can be useful, particularly when you need to transform a different data set than the one that you fit the vectorizer to, you can accomplish both steps at once using the fit_transform() method.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "10. Putting it all together\r\n",
        "Now that you have an array containing the count values of each of the words of interest, and a way to get the feature names you can combine these in a DataFrame as shown here. The add_prefix() method allows you to be able to distinguish these columns in the future.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "1 ```out Counts_aback Counts_abandon Counts_abandonment 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 0 3 0 1 0 4 0 0 0 ```\r\n",
        "11. Updating your DataFrame\r\n",
        "You can now combine this DataFrame with your original DataFrame so they can be used to generate future analytical models using pandas concat method. Checking the DataFrames shape shows the new much wider size. Remember to specify the axis argument to 1 as you want column bind these DataFrames.\r\n",

        "While counts of occurrences of words can be a good first step towards encoding your text to build models, it has some limitations. The main issue is counts will be much higher for very common even when they occur across all texts, providing little value as a distinguishing feature.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "2. Introducing TF-IDF\r\n",
        "Take for example the counts of the word \"the\" shown here, with plentiful occurrences in every row. To limit these common words from overpowering your model some form of normalization can be used. One of the most effective approaches to do this is called \"Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency\" or TF-IDF.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "3. TF-IDF\r\n",
        "TF-IDF divides number of times a word occurs in the document by a measure of what proportion of the documents a word occurs in all documents. This has the effect of reducing the value of common words, while increasing the weight of words that do not occur in many documents.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "4. Importing the vectorizer\r\n",
        "To use a TF-IDF vectorizer, the approach is very similar to how you applied a count vectorizer. First you must import TfidfVectorizer() from sklearn dot feature_extraction dot text, then you assign it to a variable name. Lets use tv in this case.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "5. Max features and stopwords\r\n",
        "Similar to when you were working with the Count vectorizer where you could limit the number of features created by specifying arguments when initializing TfidfVectorizer, you can specify the maximum number of features using max_features which will only use the 100 most common words. We will also specify the vectorizer to omit a set of stop_words, these are a predefined list of the most common english words such as \"and\" or \"the\". You can use scikit-learn's built in list, load your own, or use lists provided by other python libraries.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "6. Fitting your text\r\n",
        "Once the vectorizer has been specified you can fit it, and apply it to the text that you want to transform. Note that here we are fitting and transforming the train data, a subset of the original data.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "7. Putting it all together\r\n",
        "As before, you combine the TF-IDF values along with the feature names in a DataFrame as shown here.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "8. Inspecting your transforms\r\n",
        "After transforming your data you should always check how the different words are being valued, and see which words are receiving the highest scores through the process. This will help you understand if the features being generated make sense or not. One ad hoc method is to isolate a single row of the transformed DataFrame (`tv_df` in this case), using the iloc accessor, and then sorting the values in the row in descending order as shown here. These top ranked values make sense for the text of a presidential speech.\r\n",

        "So how do you apply this transformation on the test set? As mentioned before, you should preprocess your test data using the transformations made on the train data only. To ensure that the same features are created you should use the same vectorizer that you fit on the training data. So first transform the test data using the tv vectorizer and then recreate the test data set by combining the TF-IDF values, feature names, and other columns.\r\n",

        "So far you have looked at individual words on their own without any context or word order, this approach is called a bag-of-words model, as the words are treated as if they are being drawn from a bag with no concept of order or grammar. While analyzing the occurrences of individual words can be a valuable way to create features from a piece of text, you will notice that individual words can loose all their context/meaning when viewed independently.\r\n",

        "Take for example the word 'happy' shown here. One would assume it was used in a positive context, but if in reality it was used in the phrase 'not happy' this assumption would be incorrect. Similarly if the phrase was extended to 'never not happy' the connotation changes again. One common method to retain at least some concept of word order in a text is to instead use multiple consecutive words like pairs (bi-gram) or three consecutive words (tri-grams). This maintains at least some ordering information while at the same time allowing for the creation of a reasonable set of features.\r\n",

        "3. Using N-grams\r\n",
        "To leverage n-grams in your own models an additional argument \"ngram_range\", can be specified when instantiating your TF-IDF vectorizer. The values assigned to the argument are the minimum and maximum length of n-grams to be included. In this case you would only be looking at bi-grams (n-grams with two words) Printing the bi-gram features created we can see the pairs of words instead of single words.\r\n",

        "4. Finding common words\r\n",
        "As mentioned in the last video, when creating new features, you should always take time to check your work, and ensure that the features you are creating make sense. A good way to check your n-grams is to see what are the most common values being recorded. This can be done by summing the values of your DataFrame of count values that you created using the sum() method.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "5. Finding common words\r\n",
        "After sorting the values in descending order you can see the most commonly occurring values. It comes as no surprise that the most commonly occurring bi-gram in a dataset of US president's speeches is \"United States\" which indicates that the features being created make sense.\r\n",
