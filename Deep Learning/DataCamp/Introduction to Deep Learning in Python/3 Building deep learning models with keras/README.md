Building deep learning models with keras

In this chapter, you'll use the Keras library to build deep learning models for both regression and classification. You'll learn about the Specify-Compile-Fit workflow that you can use to make predictions, and by the end of the chapter, you'll have all the tools necessary to build deep neural networks.
