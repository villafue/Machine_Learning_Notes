        "Now that you've used XGBoost to both build and evaluate regression as well as classification models, you should get a handle on how to visually explore your models. Here, you will visualize individual trees from the fully boosted model that XGBoost creates using the entire housing dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "XGBoost has a plot_tree() function that makes this type of visualization easy. Once you train a model using the XGBoost learning API, you can pass it to the plot_tree() function along with the number of trees you want to plot using the num_trees argument.\n",

        "Excellent! Have a look at each of the plots. They provide insight into how the model arrived at its final decisions and what splits it made to arrive at those decisions. This allows us to identify which features are the most important in determining house price. In the next exercise, you'll learn another way of visualizing feature importances."
