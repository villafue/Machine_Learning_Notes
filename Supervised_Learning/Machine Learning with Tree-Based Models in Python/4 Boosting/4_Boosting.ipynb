        "More formally, in boosting many weak learners are combined to form a strong learner. A weak learner is a model doing slightly better than random guessing. For example, a decision tree with a maximum-depth of one, known as a decision-stump, is a weak learner.\r\n",

        "In boosting, an ensemble of predictors are trained sequentially and each predictor tries to correct the errors made by its predecessor. The two boosting methods you'll explore in this course are AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "4. Adaboost\r\n",
        "AdaBoost stands for Adaptive Boosting. In AdaBoost, each predictor pays more attention to the instances wrongly predicted by its predecessor by constantly changing the weights of training instances. Furthermore, each predictor is assigned a coefficient alpha that weighs its contribution in the ensemble's final prediction. Alpha depends on the predictor's training error.\r\n",

        "As shown in the diagram, there are N predictors in total. First, predictor1 is trained on the initial dataset (X,y), and the training error for predictor1 is determined. This error can then be used to determine alpha1 which is predictor1's coefficient. Alpha1 is then used to determine the weights W(2) of the training instances for predictor2. Notice how the incorrectly predicted instances shown in green acquire higher weights. When the weighted instances are used to train predictor2, this predictor is forced to pay more attention to the incorrectly predicted instances. This process is repeated sequentially, until the N predictors forming the ensemble are trained.\r\n",

        "Once all the predictors in the ensemble are trained, the label of a new instance can be predicted depending on the nature of the problem. For classification, each predictor predicts the label of the new instance and the ensemble's prediction is obtained by weighted majority voting. For regression, the same procedure is applied and the ensemble's prediction is obtained by performing a weighted average. It's important to note that individual predictors need not to be CARTs. However CARTs are used most of the time in boosting because of their high variance.\r\n",

First, instead of providing all the training instances to a tree, only a fraction of these instances are provided through sampling without replacement. The sampled data is then used for training a tree. However, not all features are considered when a split is made. Instead, only a certain randomly sampled fraction of these features are used for this purpose. Once a tree is trained, predictions are made and the residual errors can be computed. These residual errors are multiplied by the learning rate eta and are fed to the next tree in the ensemble. This procedure is repeated sequentially until all the trees in the ensemble are trained.
