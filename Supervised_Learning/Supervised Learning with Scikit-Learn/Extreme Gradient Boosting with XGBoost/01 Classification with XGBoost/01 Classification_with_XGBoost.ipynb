I'm a data scientist working in the media industry and have used XGBoost extensively on a variety of machine learning problems. I've created this course with DataCamp to help others quickly understand how to use this very popular implementation of gradient boosting. Let's get started.\r\n",

        "3. Supervised learning\r\n",
        "supervised learning is and the kinds of problems its methods can be applied to. At its core, supervised learning, which is the kind of learning problems that XGBoost can be applied to, relies on labeled data. That is, you have some understanding of the past behavior of the problem you're trying to solve or what you're trying to predict.\r\n",

        "4. Supervised learning example\r\n",
        "For example, assessing whether a specific image contains a person's face, is a classification problem. Here the training data are images converted into vectors of pixel values, and the labels are either 1 when the image contains a face or 0 when the image doesn't contain a face. Given this, there are two kinds of supervised learning problems that account for the vast majority of use-cases: classification problems and regression problems. We will only talk about classification problems here and leave regression to chapter 2.\r\n",

        "the AUC, or Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, is the most versatile and common evaluation metric used to judge the quality of a binary classification model. It is simply the probability that a randomly chosen positive data point will have a higher rank than a randomly chosen negative data point for your learning problem.

        "All supervised learning problems, including classification problems, require that the data is structured as a table of feature vectors, where the features themselves (also called attributes or predictors) are either numeric or categorical. Furthermore, it is usually the case that numeric features are scaled to aid in either feature interpretation or to ensure that the model can be trained properly (for example, numerical feature scaling is essential to ensure properly trained support vector machine models). Categorical features are also almost always encoded before applying supervised learning algorithms, most commonly using one-hot encoding. Finally, other kinds of supervised learning problems exist, so I'll mention them here briefly.\r\n",

        "XGBoost is an incredibly popular machine learning library for good reason. It was developed originally as a C++ command-line application. After winning a popular machine learning competition, the package started being adopted within the ML community. As a result, bindings, or functions that tapped into the core C++ code, started appearing in a variety of other languages, including Python, R, Scala, and Julia. We will cover the Python API in this course.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "3. What makes XGBoost so popular?\r\n",
        "What makes XGBoost so popular? Its speed and performance. Because the core XGBoost algorithm is parallelizable, it can harness all of the processing power of modern multi-core computers. Furthermore, it is parallelizable onto GPU's and across networks of computers, making it feasible to train models on very large datasets on the order of hundreds of millions of training examples. However, XGBoost's speed isn't the package's real draw. Ultimately, a fast but poorly performing machine learning algorithm is not going to have wide adoption within the community. What makes XGBoost so popular is that it consistently outperforms almost all other single-algorithm methods in machine learning competitions and has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark machine learning datasets. Here's an example of how we can use XGBoost using a classification problem.\r\n",

Remember, you always build a machine learning model using train/test splits of your data, where some portion of your data is used for training, and the remainder is held-out for testing to ensure that your model doesn't overfit and can generalize to unseen data. In lines 5 and 6 we load our data in from file and split the entire dataset into a matrix of samples by features, called X by convention, and a vector of target values, called y by convention. In line 7 we create our train/test split, keeping 20% of the data for testing. In line 8 we instantiate our xgboost classifier instance with some parameters that we will cover shortly. Lines 9 and 10 should appear familiar to you. XGBoost has a scikit-learn compatible api, and this is it! It uses the fit/predict pattern that you should have seen before, where we fit, or train, our algorithm on the training set, and then evaluate it by generating predictions using the test set and comparing our predictions to the actual target labels on the test set. Lines 11 and 12 evaluate the accuracy of the trained model on the test set and print the results to screen.\r\n",

        "Here is an example decision tree. As you can see, it has a single question that is being asked at each decision node, and only 2 possible choices, at the very bottom of each decision tree, there is a single possible decision. In this example decision tree for whether to purchase a vehicle, the first question you ask is whether it has been road-tested. If it hasn't, you immediately decide not to buy, otherwise, you continue asking questions, such as what the vehicle's mileage is, and, if its age is old or recent. At bottom, every possible decision will eventually lead to a choice, some taking many fewer questions to get to those choices than others.\r\n",

This is important because XGBoost itself is an ensemble learning method in that it uses the outputs of many models for a final prediction. Anyway, as you saw in the previous slide, a decision tree is a learning method that involves a tree-like graph to model either a continuous or categorical choice given some data. It is composed of a series of binary decisions (yes/no or true/false questions) that when answered in succession ultimately yield a prediction about the data at hand (these predictions happen at the leaves of the tree).\r\n",

During construction, the tree is built one split at a time, and the way that a split is selected (that is, what feature to split on and where in the feature's range of values to split) can vary, but involves choosing a split point that segregates the target values better (puts each target category into buckets that are increasingly dominated by just one category) until all (or nearly all) values within a given split are exclusively of one category or another. Using this process, each leaf of the decision tree will have a single category in the majority, or should be exclusively of one category.\r\n",

        "1. What is Boosting?\r\n",
        "Now that we've reviewed both supervised learning and the basics of decision trees, lets talk about the core concept that gives XGBoost its state-of-the-art performance, boosting.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "2. Boosting overview\r\n",
        "At bottom, boosting isn't really a specific machine learning algorithm, but a concept that can be applied to a set of machine learning models. So, its really a meta-algorithm. Specifically, it is an ensemble meta-algorithm primarily used to reduce any given single learner's variance and to convert many weak learners into an arbitrarily strong learner.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "3. Weak learners and strong learners\r\n",
        "A weak learner is any machine learning algorithm that is just slightly better than chance. So, a decision tree that can predict some outcome slightly more frequently than pure randomness would be considered a weak learner. The principal insight that allows XGBoost to work is the fact that you can use boosting to convert a collection of weak learners into a strong learner. Where a strong learner is any algorithm that can be tuned to achieve arbitrarily good performance for some supervised learning problem.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "4. How boosting is accomplished\r\n",
        "How is this accomplished? By iteratively learning a set of weak models on subsets of the data you have at hand, and weighting each of their predictions according to each weak learner's performance. You then combine all of the weak learners' predictions multiplied by their weights to obtain a single final weighted prediction that is much better than any of the individual predictions themselves. It's kind of incredible that this works as well as it does.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "5. Boosting example\r\n",
        "Here is a very basic example of boosting using 2 decision trees. This example comes from the XGBoost documentation and shows that given a specific example, each tree gives a different prediction score depending on the data it sees. The prediction scores for each possibility are summed across trees and the prediction is simply the sum of the scores across both trees. Here, you can see that whatever it was we were trying to predict, the little boy had a higher predicted score summed across both trees than the old man.\r\n",

        "6. Model evaluation through cross-validation\r\n",
        "Since we will be working with XGBoost's learning API for model evaluation next, it's a good idea to briefly provide you with an example that shows how model evaluation using cross-validation works with XGBoost's learning API (which is different from the scikit-learn compatible API) as it has cross-validation capabilities baked in. As a refresher, cross-validation is a robust method for estimating the expected performance of a machine learning model on unseen data by generating many non-overlapping train/test splits on your training data and reporting the average test set performance across all data splits.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "7. Cross-validation in XGBoost example\r\n",
        "So, in lines 1 and 2 we import what we will be using. In line 3, we load in our example dataset. In line 4, we convert our dataset into an optimized data structure that the creators of XGBoost made that gives the package its lauded performance and efficiency gains called a DMatrix. In the previous exercise, the input datasets were converted into DMatrix data on the fly, but when we use the XGBoost cv object, which is part of XGBoost's learning api we have to first explicitly convert our data into a DMatrix. So, that's what we are doing here before we run our cross-validation. In line 5, we are creating a parameter dictionary to pass into our cross-validation. This is necessary because the cv method has no idea what kind of XGBoost model we are using and expects us to provide that information as a dictionary of appropriate key-value pairs. Our parameter dictionary here is bare-bones, only providing the objective function we would like to use and the maximum depth that every tree can grow to. In line 6, we call the cv method and pass in our DMatrix object storing all of our data, the parameter dictionary, the number of cross-validation folds, how many trees we want to build, what metric we want to compute, and whether we want our output to be stored as a pandas dataframe. In line 7 we simply convert our metrics into an accuracy and output the results to screen.\r\n",

Although your definition of large can vary, I intend it to mean a dataset that has few features and at least 1000 examples. However, in general, as long as the number of features in your training set is smaller than the number of examples you have, you should be fine.
