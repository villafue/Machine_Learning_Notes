Notes:

1. Confusion Matrix / Classification Report via knn and train/test/split
2. Same as above but with example of Logistic Regression
3. ROC Curve
4. Precision Recall Curve
5. AUC Compution
6. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch and RandomSearch
7. Classification Example: hyperparameter grid, train/test/split, gridsearch, .fit with x/y train, .best_params_, .best_score_
8. Regression Example: Elastic Net Example (mix of Lasso and Ridge), train/test/split, gridsearch, .fit, .predict, .r2 score with x/y test, mse
