In this exercise, you will dive more deeply into evaluating the performance of binary classifiers by computing a confusion matrix and generating a classification report.\n",

The support gives the number of samples of the true response that lie in that class - so in the video example, the support was the number of Republicans or Democrats in the test set on which the classification report was computed. The precision, recall, and f1-score columns, then, gave the respective metrics for that particular class.\n",

A target value of 0 indicates that the patient does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the patient does have diabetes.

A solution to this is to use RandomizedSearchCV, in which not all hyperparameter values are tried out. Instead, a fixed number of hyperparameter settings is sampled from specified probability distributions. You'll practice using RandomizedSearchCV in this exercise and see how this works.\n",

Just like k-NN, linear regression, and logistic regression, decision trees in scikit-learn have .fit() and .predict() methods that you can use in exactly the same way as before. Decision trees have many parameters that can be tuned, such as max_features, max_depth, and min_samples_leaf: This makes it an ideal use case for RandomizedSearchCV.\n",
