Hyperparameters and Parameters

In this introductory chapter you will learn the difference between hyperparameters and parameters. You will practice extracting and analyzing parameters, setting hyperparameter values for several popular machine learning algorithms. Along the way you will learn some best practice tips & tricks for choosing which hyperparameters to tune and what values to set & build learning curves to analyze your hyperparameter choices.
